<!--
  Start your web page with an <html> tag 
    i) Add a heading. 
    ii) Add a title. 
    iii) Start the <body> section. 
    iv) Add the following text using <H1> and </H1> tags: This Web page was designed by (your name)
    v)  Add the following text using <H2> and </H2> tags: My HTML assignment 
    vi) Add a horizontal line
    vii) Insert an image to your web page.  

    Note:  You should then refer to your image with just the filename, and NOT the entire pathname 
           to the file.

    viii) Add another horizontal line. 
    ix) Enter a paragraph of text.  
          Write about things you have learned in html.
		  
    Make sure the text in this paragraph is a color 
    other than black, but something one can see. 
    Add a link that takes you to your favorite web page. 

    x)  Start a new paragraph. Add a three item ordered list. 
	    Make it creative (don’t just say item 1, item 2, etc… and keep it clean)! 
    xi) Close out your body and html tags.
