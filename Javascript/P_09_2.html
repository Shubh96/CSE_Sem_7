<!-- Write a program in JavaScript where the program chooses a number between 1 and 20. 
You are then prompted to enter a guess. If the players guess wrong then the prompt appears 
again until the guess is correct. When the player has made a successful guess the computer will 
give a “Well Guessed!” message, and the program will exit.
